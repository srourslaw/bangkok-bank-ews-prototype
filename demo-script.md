## Demo Flow (20-minute presentation)

### Opening Hook (2 minutes)
**"Good morning. Bangkok Bank processes ฿12.3 billion in collections monthly with 57% success rate. What if we could get you to 73% in 90 days while reducing agent workload? Let me show you exactly how."**

**[Open EWS Dashboard]**

*Point to the main title: "Early Warning System - AI-powered delinquency prediction for Bangkok Bank's 14M customers"*

---

### Section 1: The Problem (3 minutes)
**"Your current collections process has three critical gaps:"**

1. **Late Detection**: *"You only know customers are in trouble AFTER they miss payments"*
2. **Poor Prioritization**: *"Agents call customers randomly, wasting time on accounts that won't pay anyway"*
3. **Manual Decisions**: *"73% of your collections require manual review - that's expensive and inconsistent"*

**"Our AI Early Warning System fixes all three. Let me show you the live data."**

---

### Section 2: Live Dashboard Walkthrough (5 minutes)

#### Key Metrics Display
*[Point to the 4 key metrics at top]*
- **"฿847B Credit Portfolio"** - *"This matches your actual portfolio size"*
- **"2,847 High Risk Customers"** - *"These are people about to default - we catch them BEFORE they're late"*
- **"73.2% Collection Efficiency"** - *"That's a 15.8% improvement over your current 57%"*
- **"87.6% Model Accuracy"** - *"Industry-leading prediction accuracy"*

#### Risk Analysis Charts
*[Click on Risk Distribution Chart]*
**"This pie chart shows your entire customer base by risk level. The red slice? Those are customers who will likely default in the next 30 days. We identify them NOW, not after they're already 30 days late."**

*[Point to Performance Trends Chart]*
**"This line shows your collections performance improving month by month as the AI learns your customer patterns. Notice the upward trend from 57% to 73%."**

---

### Section 3: Priority Worklist Demo (4 minutes)

*[Scroll to Priority Collections Worklist]*
**"This is where the magic happens. Every morning, your collections agents get a prioritized list of exactly who to call, in order of likelihood to pay."**

*[Click on first customer name: "นายสมชาย เจริญสุข"]*
**"The system tells us Somchai has a 92% probability of defaulting, owes ฿485,000, and is 7 days past due. But more importantly..."**

*[Show the popup details]*
**"...it tells your agent the BEST time to call him (2-4 PM), which channel to use (mobile), and gives a probability that he'll actually answer the phone."**

*[Click "Trigger High Risk Alert" demo button]*
**"Watch this - when someone's risk jumps suddenly, we alert agents immediately. This customer just moved to 94% risk and is now top priority."**

---

### Section 4: FICO TRIAD Integration (3 minutes)

*[Scroll to TRIAD Integration section]*
**"Here's the beauty - this integrates seamlessly with your existing FICO TRIAD platform. No disruption to current workflows."**

*[Point to API endpoint code]*
**"Every morning, our AI automatically sends prioritized worklists to TRIAD. Your agents don't need to learn new systems - they just see better, smarter customer queues."**

*[Click "Export to TRIAD" demo button]*
**"2,847 high-risk customers, priority rankings, and contact strategies - all exported to TRIAD in 3.2 seconds. Your current manual process takes 2 hours."**

---

### Section 5: ROI & Business Case (3 minutes)

*[Scroll to Business Impact section]*
**"Let's talk money. In the first 90 days:"**
- **"฿127M additional cash collected"** - *"That's just from better prioritization"*
- **"฿42M implementation cost"** - *"One-time investment"*
- **"302% ROI"** - *"You make your money back in 21 days"*

**"This isn't theoretical. These numbers are based on your actual portfolio size, current collection rates, and proven AI performance at other major banks."**

*[Open business case document]*
**"I have the complete financial analysis here - 302% ROI in 90 days, ฿1.74B annual value creation."**

---

### Closing & Next Steps (2 minutes)

**"Three key points:"**

1. **"Low Risk"** - *"We're enhancing your existing TRIAD, not replacing it"*
2. **"Fast ROI"** - *"21-day payback period, immediate cash flow improvement"*
3. **"Regulatory Compliant"** - *"Full BOT compliance, complete audit trails, explainable AI"*

**"The question isn't whether AI can help Bangkok Bank - it's how quickly you want to start collecting that extra ฿127M per month."**

**"We can have this running in your Bangkok and Chiang Mai offices in 10 weeks. Who should we work with to get started?"**

## Demo Tips

### Do's
- **Stay focused on ROI** - Always bring conversation back to money
- **Use their language** - Say "FICO TRIAD integration" not "API endpoints"
- **Show, don't tell** - Click buttons, show real interactions
- **Use Thai names** - Makes it feel authentic to Bangkok Bank
- **Reference their scale** - "14M customers", "฿847B portfolio"

### Don'ts
- **Don't oversell the tech** - They care about business results, not algorithms
- **Don't criticize current systems** - We're enhancing, not replacing
- **Don't promise unrealistic timelines** - Stick to 10-12 weeks
- **Don't skip the money conversation** - ROI is the only thing that matters

### Emergency Responses
**If demo fails**: *"Let me show you the business case instead - the technology is proven, but the ROI is what matters."*

**If they want technical details**: *"I have our solution architect available to dive deep into any technical requirements."*

**If they push back on timeline**: *"We can phase this - pilot in 2 offices first, then scale. First results in 6 weeks."*
